# Gerstner Waves

Gerstner Waves is an interactive visualization that simulates wave dynamics using Gerstner's formula. This implementation uses pure JavaScript and the HTML `<canvas>` element to create a realistic and efficient animation of waves over time.

## Description

The simulation creates particles that represent points on a wave and moves them according to the Gerstner wave equation. The visualization includes a `Particle` class that defines the appearance and behavior of each point on the wave.

Gerstner waves are a mathematical description of the shape of a wave on a surface. The equation is parametric, allowing for a detailed depiction of the wave's shape based on certain parameters.

## Features

- Visual representation of waves using the Gerstner wave equation.
- Utilizes HTML `<canvas>` element to render the animation.
- Simulation is controlled through a `Particle` class that defines the shape and motion of each point on the wave.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or Create a new GitHub Codespaces.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

## Customization

You can customize the simulation by modifying the constants and parameters in the `script.js` file.

- Change the number of particles, speed, and other wave parameters.
- Customize the appearance of the particles by editing the `Particle` class.
